# Morse-Convert-Reddit

I don't know why I did this but I did... Anyways to use it's straightforward. Likely won't be used but something I did for fun for y'all :)

```
# Binary Tree Method
x = Morse_B("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
x.convert_to_morse()
x.convert_to_string()

Will Return...
THE ENCODED MESSAGE IS: ._/_.../_._./_.././.._./__./..../../.___/_._/._../__/_./___/.__./__._/._./.../_/.._/..._/.__/_.._/_.__/__..
THE TRANSLATED MESSAGE IS: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

# Trie Method (Same output just using a trie data structure.
x = Morse_T("SOS")
x.convert_to_morse()
x.convert_to_string()

Will Return...
THE ENCODED MESSAGE IS: .../___/...
THE TRANSLATED MESSAGE IS: SOS
```
